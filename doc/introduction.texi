@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

The document presents the results obtained during my collaboration
with the Domotic Laboratory at the Institute of Science and Technologies of
Information ISTI ``Alessandro Faedo'' of the CNR in Pisa. This project is located 
within the ``Home Automation Technologies and Standards'' 
(@indicize{HATS}@footnote{http://hats.isti.cnr.it}) research area. 
The project purpose is to develop an architecture based on new technologies
to create intelligent domestic atmospheres that concur at the integration and
interoperability of the offered services.

@section The problem

The slang of new technologies has gone enriching of new terms as
@indicize{Home Automation}, @indicize{Building Automation}, @indicize{Smart Home}.
They are all synonyms diverted by the @indicize{domotique} neologism.
The @indicize{domotique} neologism was coined in
France and it is composed by the fusion of two terms: @indicize{domus} and
@indicize{informatique}.
The @indicize{domotique} neologism is recovered in Italy with the
@indicize{domotica} term and represents
the technology applications of the information and communication in the
domestic world, to improve the comfort and the control.

Domotics parnorama is still in development. The industry and the market has
played (and they still play) a role of primary importance for the definitive
take-off of the domotic technologies. Different industry coalitions have 
promoted numerous middlewares and standards 
always more sophisticated and always too poorly interoperable each others
This has made the domotics an unexploded bomb.
The world of research and industry are waiting for the that ``boom`` that is not
still happened. The real employment of the domotic technology is
still hindered by the attempt of each industry to impose its standard on the
others. The presence of a so vast number of domotic standards announces that
hardly will be
the definitive consecration of one of them.
It is as much unlikely that all the coalitions gather about to
realize an unique middleware that represents the standard @keyWord{de facto}
for the domotics.

Pervasive Computing and Ambient Intelligence (AmI) visions are still far from being achieved, especially with regard to Domotics and home applications. According to the vision of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), the most advanced technologies are those that disappear: at maturity, computer technology should become invisible. All the objects surrounding us must possess sufficient computing capacity to interact with users, the surroundings and each other. The entire physical environment in which users are immersed should thus be a hidden computer system equipped with the appropriate software in order to exhibit intelligent behaviour. Even though many implementations have started to appear in several contexts, few applications have been made available for the home environment and the general public. 

My proposal is to realize a practicable solution that is able to guarantee the
definitive affirmation of the domotics. My solution consists in the realization 
of a @keyWord{framework} based on the standard technology of @keyWord{web service},
and on an XML grammar called @indicize{domoML}.
The goal proposed by the @keyWord{framework} is the integration and to act a sort of
interoperability among services offered by the main middlewares currently available.

@section The domotics
The domotics constitutes all the technologies that are dedicated at the
integration of electronic devices, appliances, systems of communication and
control placed inside a domestic environment.
The purposes that the domotic applications establish are:

@itemize @bullet

@item the increase of the level of comfort: 
domotic applications must offer a more pleasant space in the house
facilitating its management especially for disabled and diseased consumers (for example,
controlling audio/video, monitoring and activating remote appliances, shine,
blinds, gates, etc.);

@item the attainment of a suitable safety level:
the domotic applications have to guarantee the safety of the consumer to front
situations of emergency (for example, anti-intrusion techniques, the raise 
of fires, the escape of gas, etc.);

@item the search of techniques for the energetic saving:
the employment of the domotics has to allow a more accurate and
efficient management on the level of the energetic consumptions (for example, advanced
tools to get information that allow a more equitable distribution of the
energetic loads).

@end itemize

It's sure that the domotics proposes futuristic and positive
impact sceneries on the quality of our life.
Unfortunately there are numerous technologies and different domotic standards
that are poorly interoperable among them.
This incompatibility represents an obstacle to
the expansion of the market.
From the point of view of the final consumer it's very complicated and
perhaps even little comprehensible perceive the necessity to buy
domotic technologies instead of traditional devices.
In fact the potential beneficents that would divert from the acquisition of
this products doesn't succeed to justify an economic greater effort: the
introduction of "intelligence", understood as ability of calculation, in an any
device, involve additional costs always more small.
Besides, on account of the scarce interoperability among various standards,
the consumer is forced to acquire only the conforming products to a particular
system and it could happen in two conditions: the contemporary acquisition of
all the devices, or a technical knowledge that allow the user to knowledge the
previously used standard in order to acquire further conforming devices.
Both the conditions are however of difficult realization because in the most of
the cases. In particular, as regard the first condition It must be considered
that the domestic environment is very dynamic: the home elements change
frequently and the devices come acquired in different moments.
It is in fact rare that all that devices in a residence are acquired
contemporary. To understand the interoperability issue, let's suppose to have
a coffee pot that is able to turn on itself through a radio alarm to a
pre-established hour. If the radio alarm and the coffee pot "speak the same
tongue" (have the same standard), every morning it will be possible have a
ready coffee just wake. If one of the two devices must be changed, it will be
necessary to replace appliance with an other of the same standard.
It is instead desirable to allow the consumer to choose the devices
independently from the standard which they belong: in this way the final user
doesnâ€™t have to know the technical detailed knowledge of the installed system
inside his home. His only attention should be to exclusively take advantage of
all the possible benefits offered by the devices. 


@subsection @emph{Domotic middlewares}
Domotic middlewares can be divided in two great classes that differ
substantially for the system of communication used:

@itemize @bullet
@item bus systems: more traditional and consolidated in the domoticWorld.
There are standards as X10, EIB, BatiBus, EHS, Konnex, LonWorks, CEBus;
@item protocolos more evolved as TCP/IP: more recent as UPnP, Jini, OSGi.
@end itemize

To the side of a particular system of communication, is available a number
always greater of standards that realise transmissions as IEEE 802.11b
(Wi-penalties), Bluetooth, IEEE 1394 (Firewire), IrDA, ZigBee, etc.

@section The solution: @emph{DomoNet}

One of the main objective of the work is to study and to implement an 
architecture to face the issue of the cooperation among heterogeneous 
devices from the technological point of view. 
This is possible creating a level of abstraction that allows to 
characterize the domotic devices from a behavioural and physical point 
of view. 
The abstraction layer aims to furnish a homogeneous description of all devices 
independently from the belonging technologies. 
  
The @indicize{domoNet architecture} is composed by a server part that 
implements the management of domotic devices like the abstraction layer 
and the cooperation feature, and by one or more clients able to send requests 
to the server in order to activate domotic actuators and to query domotic 
sensors receiving a response from them. 
Client functioning can range from a simple remote control to a more 
sophisticated tool able to take decisions by evaluating contextual and 
environmental parameters to implement intelligent and specialized services 
(e.g. related to Ambient Intelligence, e-health, energy saving).

@caption{The domoNet architecture}
@end float

In @ref{fig:ex1} the client is composed by two elements: the 
@indicize{domoNet Client} that implements the business logic and the methods 
for interactions with the sever part and the 
@indicize{domoNet Client User Interface} that implements the user interface 
like a Web or desktop application, an app for the smartphone and so on. 
The server part is composed by the communication interfaces and business logic 
(webService) and by one or more @keyWord{techManager}.
@keyWord{techManager}s are special gateway able to interface domotic 
technologies (such as @indicize{KNX},
@indicize{UPnP}, @indicize{X10} @indicize{ZigBee} and so on) and to integrate
them in the middleware.
